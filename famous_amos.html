                <h2>The Project</h2>
                <p>Evaluate the current brand strategy of Famous Amos Singapore and develop strategies to enhance its relevance over the next 5-10 years. <br><br>
                    Team Dynamics:<br>
                    🚀 A Business Marketing team with diverse professional internship experiences. <br><br>
                    What We Delivered:<br>
                    📌 A business proposal for the Famous Amos executives. <br>
                    🎤 A storytelling-driven presentation to effectively communicate our insights and recommendations. <br><br>
                    Timeline:<br>
                    One semester to research, strategize, and present a meaningful business proposal.

                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <p>🔍 Secondary Data – We leveraged insights from Famous Amos executives, the company website, news outlets, and current marketing strategies to gauge brand awareness, association, and positioning. <br><br>
                    📊 Primary Data – We designed a Google Forms survey to better understand consumer behavior and perception toward the brand. <br><br>
                    Our research revealed that the brand lacks excitement and memorability especially among Gen Z consumers. <br><br>
                    To ensure long-term relevance, we proposed short-term and long-term brand repositioning strategies that blends modern trends with its nostalgic heritage: <br><br>

                    🍰 Strategic Brand Partnerships <br>
                    🚚 Famous Amos Cookie Truck <br>

            <section class="the-process">
                <h2>Final Product</h2>
                <p>As we brainstormed and structured our presentation, an idea struck me—what if we personified our target segment? I pitched this idea to my team, and everyone was immediately on board. <br><br>
                    This led to the creation of Jack, a user persona who became the main character in our storytelling approach. Our goal? Convince Jack to say YES to Famous Amos cookies despite the overwhelming snack choices available to him. <br><br>
                </p>

                    </figure>
                <p>
                    From there, we worked together to develop Jack’s journey, shaping our presentation into a dynamic, engaging experience rather than just a standard business pitch. <br><br>
                </p>

                    </figure>
                <p>
                    🎬 Starting strong: We kicked off with a short, animated video introducing Jack and his dilemma—what snack should he choose? <br>
                    💡 Building the case: Throughout our presentation, we positioned our insights and recommendations as compelling reasons for Jack to pick Famous Amos. <br>
                    🎉 Closing with impact: We ended with another animated clip, bringing the story full circle and showing Jack finally saying YES! <br>

                <p>Design Choices that Enhanced Engagement: <br>
                    🎨 Typeface with Personality – We played with typography at key moments to visually reinforce our points. <br>
                    📊 More Visuals, Fewer Words – Weprioritized visual storytelling over text-heavy explanations. <br>
                    🌈 Brand-Consistent Colors – We used Famous Amos’ signature blue and yellow to maintain brand familiarity while ensuring a cohesive visual identity. <br>
                    🍪 Fun, Interactive Details – In slides featuring Jack, I added a "cookie bite" effect on the top corner, making it look like Jack was actually taking a bite—just like chomping on a Famous Amos cookie! <br>

                <h2>My Reflection</h2>
                <p>While we didn’t emerge as winners of this client pitch, this project has been an invaluable experience—one that capped off my university journey with immense personal and professional growth. <br><br>
                    Stepping up as the first speaker, I had the opportunity to apply marketing frameworks I have learnt to provide a well-rounded understanding of the brand’s position by connecting the dots between theory and real-world application. <br><br>
                </p>

                        <figcaption>SWOT Analysis of overall business</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                <p>Before this project, I had zero experience in graphic design and animation. However, when we decided to bring Jack to life, I was determined to make it happen despite knowledge, time, and budget constraints. <br><br>
                    There’s still plenty of room for improvement, but it was a significant leap outside my comfort zone. I learned to break down a complex idea into actionable steps, navigate design tools, and turn an abstract vision into a tangible, engaging experience. <br><br>
                    This experience has reaffirmed my passion for creating engaging content—one that doesn’t just inform but captures imaginations. <br><br>
                    Lastly, a huge shoutout to my teammates—Wesley, Jeff, Zhi Qi, Edel, and Zhe Xian! Their enthusiasm, support, and collaboration made this journey a truly fulfilling one!
