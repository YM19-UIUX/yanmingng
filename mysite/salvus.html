                <h2>The Project</h2>
                <p>Challenge: <br> 
                    Leverage a cutting-edge technology introduced in the module to address a real-world societal problem. <br><br>
                    
                    What We Delivered:<br>
                    ðŸ“Œ A visually compelling A3 poster that captured our research and solution.<br>
                    ðŸŽ¤ An oral presentation to effectively communicate our findings and impact. <br><br>
                    
                    Team Dynamics:<br>
                    ðŸš€ A diverse, multi-disciplinary team spanning Computer Engineering, Environmental Engineering, English Humanities, and Business Marketing.<br><br>
                    
                    Timeline:<br>
                    13 weeks (one semester) to research, ideate, and deliver a meaningful solution.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="the-process">
                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <p>Through extensive research, we discovered a growing issue on TikTokâ€”the rise of malicious comments that contribute to anxiety, distress, body insecurity, and unhealthy habits. While TikTok has built-in comment control mechanisms, these come with limitations. For example, Singaporeâ€™s laws focus on removing harmful content (videos, posts) rather than individual hurtful comments. <br><br>

                    Seeing the need for a proactive solution, our team leveraged Artificial Intelligence (AI) to develop Salvusâ€”Latin for "safe." Salvus is an AI-powered content filter designed to detect and block harmful comments before they are posted, reducing exposure to negativity in the first place. <br><br>
                    
                    How It Works: <br>
                    Real-time content detection â€“ Salvus analyzes text input before posting. <br>
                    AI-powered filtering â€“ Built on a perceptron-based artificial neural network, mimicking human decision-making to classify data accurately. <br>
                    Autonomous & scalable â€“ Functions with minimal human intervention, making moderation more efficient. <br><br> </p>

            <section class="final-product">
                <h2>Final Product</h2>
                <p>After multiple iterations, incorporating instructor feedback, and countless Zoom discussions, we refined our work via a shared Canva document together to work on its content, structure, and aesthetics. <br><br>

                    Our team took a minimalist yet impactful approachâ€”ensuring our ideas were communicated clearly and concisely with: <br>
                    ðŸŽ¨ A visually appealing design that let visuals do the talking. <br>
                    ðŸ”¤ A classy serif font for titles and subheadings, paired with an easy-to-read sans-serif for the main content. <br>
                    ðŸ‘€ A soft, eye-friendly color palette for a polished, professional look. <br>
                    ðŸ¤– Salvus to add a personable touch, a friendly mascot robot that symbolizes a safer social space for users. <br>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/portfolio/salvus/poster.png" alt="final poster">
                        <figcaption>Salvus Group Presentation Poster</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                <p>One of the most notable pieces of feedback we received was that our posterâ€™s organization, presentation, and style were exemplary: <br><br>
                    âœ… Logical & well-structured â€“ Clear, coherent flow with focused content. <br>
                    âœ… Visually engaging â€“ Effective use of visuals to enhance understanding. <br>
                    âœ… Concise & impactful â€“ No unnecessary details, just meaningful insights. <br>
                    âœ… Properly cited â€“ All content and visuals were well-referenced. <br>
                    
                    This final product wasnâ€™t just a presentation of our ideasâ€”it was a reflection of our dedication to creating something meaningful and effective.</p>

            <section class="my-reflection">
                <h2>My Reflection</h2>
                <p>This project transformed how I view interdisciplinary collaboration, showing me the power of diverse perspectives in solving complex challenges, leading to unique solutions and fresh insights. By combining expertise from different fields, we enhanced creativity and efficiency, leading to a significant improvement in our final deliverables and even an upgraded grade from our initial proposal. <br><br>
                    As the project coordinator, I had the opportunity to: <br>
                    âœ” Facilitate collaboration â€“ Bridging disciplinary gaps and integrating diverse ideas. <br>
                    âœ” Encourage open discussions â€“ Consulting our instructor and refining our target audience. <br>
                    âœ” Lead decision-making â€“ Ensuring effective delegation and alignment across team members. <br><br>
                    If I could do one thing differently, it would be to seek even more diverse perspectives. While our team had a strong mix of technical and strategic skills, we lacked varied cultural insights that could have enriched our approach. Conducting primary researchâ€”such as expert interviews and user feedbackâ€”would have provided a broader, more inclusive foundation for our project. These lessons will continue to guide me as I navigate the ever-evolving digital landscape. <br><br>
                    A huge shoutout to my teammatesâ€”Joanna, Pei Xuan, Wei Ze, and Ziyuâ€”for their dedication, creativity, and collaboration. This project wouldnâ€™t have been the same without them!</p>
