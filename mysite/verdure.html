                <h2>The Project</h2>
                <p>Challenge: <br> 
                    To produce a mid-level digital prototype with simulated functionality, as well as a comprehensive plan for a complex website, applying current best practices in UX design throughout the stages of the UI/UX development process. <br><br>
                    
                    What I Delivered:<br>
                    ðŸ“Œ A strategy document, including: <br>
                    1. Business goals & scope <br>
                    2. Sitemap <br>
                    3. Wireframes <br>
                    ðŸ“Œ A full set of visual mockups showcasing the final UI design.<br><br>
                    
                    Timeline:<br>
                    Around 3-4 months of self-studyâ€”watching lectures, reading textbooks, and countless hours of trial and error with different software, and additional learning of basic HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

            <section class="the-process">
                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <p>
                    Tackling this project required a systematic and structured approach. Since this was an individual, small-scale project focused primarily on my personal learning, I chose to use the Waterfall approach. I broke down the project into distinct phases: requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance, ensuring that each stage was thoroughly documented before moving on to the next. This linear, step-by-step process was easy to manage and helped me track progress through detailed planning and documentation. <br><br>
                    
                    The first step was to develop the business concept, which included deciding on the restaurant's name, menu, value proposition, target audience, and location. I named the restaurant Verdure, inspired by the lush green color of vegetation. The name comes from the Old French verd (meaning "green") and Latin viridis (also meaning "green"). Verdure is a rice bowl restaurant that offers fusion rice bowls made with alternative meats, focusing on sustainability and wellness. <br><br>
                    
                    With the business concept established, I crafted three distinct user personas to better understand the needs of both users and clients. These personas helped clarify the content and functionality requirements for the website. <br><br>
                    
                    Next, I applied the knowledge I gained from the course to design a sitemap, structuring the website's information flow. I aimed for simplicity and intuitiveness, keeping the user's journey in mind throughout the design process.

                    </figure>
                <p>
                    Once the sitemap was established, I created low-fidelity wireframes to outline the layout and content structure. I began by designing the desktop version of the website, keeping mobile responsiveness in mind. For the mobile version, I ensured the layout was adaptable, using a hamburger menu in the navigation bar to create a seamless mobile experience.

                    </figure>
                <p>
                    After completing the wireframes, I moved on to envisioning the final look and feel of the site. This involved selecting the typeface and color palette. I wanted the design to evoke a sense of wellness and sustainability, so I chose a calm, mellow color scheme. The typeface Pacifico was used for headings to create a friendly, inviting atmosphere, while DM Sans was chosen for body text for its readability and modern feel. These choices worked in harmony to reflect the theme of Verdure.

            <section class="the-process">
                <h2>Final Product</h2>
                <p>Building on the foundation of my lo-fi wireframes, I developed the full visual mockups, carefully integrating the chosen typefaces, color palette, and imagery. These mockups provided a detailed preview of the final website, balancing aesthetics with functionality to ensure a seamless user experience.

                    </figure>
                <p>With the visuals finalized, I brought the design to life by creating an interactive prototype in Figma. This prototype simulated the user's journey on the Verdure site, illustrating how they would navigate and place an order.

                <h2>My Reflection</h2>
                <p>Great web design goes beyond aestheticsâ€”itâ€™s about seamless, user-centric experiences. Through the Coursera UI/UX Specialization, I learned to blend design principles with usability. Additionally, I explored graphic design, typography, and layout, refining my understanding of visual storytelling. <br><br>
                    However, understanding the importance of coding in web development, I felt that gaining a deeper knowledge of web technologies would provide me with more control over my work. To this end, I dived into HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript through the Web Development for Beginners course. This knowledge equipped me with the skills to tweak my site and diagnose potential issues more effectively. <br><br>
                    Now, with both design and coding skills, Iâ€™m passionate about crafting engaging, intuitive digital experiencesâ€”and always eager to learn more!
