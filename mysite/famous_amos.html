                <h2>The Project</h2>
                <p>Challenge: <br> 
                    Evaluate the current brand strategy of Famous Amos and its relevance to consumers in Singapore. Understand how the brand is perceived today and develop strategies to enhance its relevance over the next 5-10 years. <br><br>
                    
                    What We Delivered:<br>
                    📌 A business proposal with a viable pitch tailored to Famous Amos executives. <br>
                    🎤 A storytelling-driven presentation to effectively communicate our insights and recommendations. <br><br>
                    
                    Team Dynamics:<br>
                    🚀 A Business Marketing team with diverse professional internship experiences. <br><br>
                    
                    Timeline:<br>

            <section class="the-process">
                <h2>The Process</h2>
                <p>To craft a compelling and well-rounded brand strategy for Famous Amos, we focused on three key areas: <br>
                    📌 Understanding Consumer & Competitive Insights <br>
                    📌 Proposing a New & Improved Brand Strategy <br>
                    📌 Developing an Effective Execution Plan <br><br>
                    
                    To support our recommendations, we conducted both primary and secondary research: <br>
                    🔍 Secondary Data – We leveraged insights from Famous Amos executives, the company website, news outlets, and current marketing strategies to gauge brand awareness, association, and positioning. <br>
                    📊 Primary Data – We designed a Google Forms survey to better understand consumer behavior. <br><br>
                    
                    Our research revealed that while Famous Amos is well-loved for its fresh, delicious cookies, the brand lacks excitement and memorability—especially among Gen Z consumers. To ensure long-term relevance, we proposed a brand repositioning strategy that blends modern trends with its nostalgic heritage. Our goal? Deepening customer connections and making Famous Amos a brand that’s both timeless and exciting. <br>
                    
                    After evaluating the short-term and long-term impact of various strategies, we developed three key recommendations to achieve our goal: <br>
                    🍪 ‘What Cookie Are You?’ Personality Quiz <br>
                    🍰 Strategic Brand Partnerships <br>
                    🚚 Famous Amos Cookie Truck <br>
                </section>
            
            <section class="the-process">
                <h2>Final Product</h2>
                <p>As we brainstormed and structured our presentation, an idea struck me—what if we personified our target segment? This led to the creation of Jack, a user persona who became the main character in our storytelling approach. Our goal? Convince Jack to say YES to Famous Amos cookies despite the overwhelming snack choices available to him. <br><br>

                    I pitched this idea to my team, and everyone was immediately on board. From there, we worked together to develop Jack’s journey, shaping our presentation into a dynamic, engaging experience rather than just a standard business pitch. <br><br>
                    
                    🎬 Starting strong: We kicked off with a short, animated video introducing Jack and his dilemma—what snack should he choose? <br>
                    💡 Building the case: Throughout our presentation, we positioned our insights and recommendations as compelling reasons for Jack to pick Famous Amos. <br>
                    🎉 Closing with impact: We ended with another animated clip, bringing the story full circle and showing Jack finally saying YES! <br>

                <p>Design Choices that Enhanced Engagement: <br>
                    🎨 Typeface with Personality – Instead of sticking to standard fonts, we played with typography at key moments to visually reinforce our points. <br>
                    📊 More Visuals, Fewer Words – Our slides were designed to be clear, impactful, and engaging, prioritizing visual storytelling over text-heavy explanations. <br>
                    🌈 Brand-Consistent Colors – We used Famous Amos’ signature blue and yellow to maintain brand familiarity while ensuring a cohesive visual identity. <br>
                    🍪 Fun, Interactive Details – In slides featuring Jack, I added a "cookie bite" effect on the top corner, making it look like Jack was actually taking a bite—just like chomping on a Famous Amos cookie! <br>

                <h2>My Reflection</h2>
                <p>While we didn’t emerge as winners of this client pitch, this project has been an invaluable experience—one that capped off my university journey with immense personal and professional growth. <br><br>
                    Stepping up as the first speaker, I introduced our overarching theme, market findings, and consumer insights. This was an exciting opportunity to apply what I had learned from various marketing modules—creating a consumer perception map in Excel (Marketing Analytics), using SWOT analysis, competitor analysis, and user personas to provide a well-rounded understanding of the brand’s position. This project reinforced my ability to synthesize complex marketing concepts and connect the dots between theory and real-world application.

                    </figure>
                <p>Pushing My Creative Boundaries: <br>
                    Before this project, I had zero experience in graphic design and animation. However, when we decided to bring Jack to life, I was determined to make it happen despite knowledge, time, and budget constraints. <br><br>
                    📌 From Idea to Execution: <br>
                    1. Organized our presentation into a coherent narrative flow. <br>
                    2. Identified the key aspects that needed to be highlighted in Jack’s animation. <br>
                    3. Developed a storyboard using the 5W1H method to structure Jack’s journey. <br>
                    4. Researched and selected Powtoon as the best tool to create the final product. <br><br>
                    The end result wasn’t perfect, but it was a significant leap outside my comfort zone. I learned to break down a complex idea into actionable steps, navigate design tools, and turn an abstract vision into a tangible, engaging experience. There’s still plenty of room for improvement, but this process showed me that with the right mindset and perseverance, I can develop new creative skills when the need arises. <br><br>
                    This experience has reaffirmed my passion for creating engaging content—one that doesn’t just inform but captures imaginations. Finding ways to deliver messages effectively, creatively, and memorably is something I want to continue honing as I move forward in my career. <br><br>
                    Lastly, a huge shoutout to my teammates—Wesley, Jeff, Zhi Qi, Edel, and Zhe Xian! Their enthusiasm, support, and collaboration made this journey a truly fulfilling one. This project was a testament to what can be achieved when ideas are built upon collectively and executed seamlessly as a team.
